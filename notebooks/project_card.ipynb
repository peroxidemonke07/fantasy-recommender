    "# **Project Card: Fantasy League Team Recommender**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Business View**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Background**\n",
    "In fantasy cricket leagues, participants assemble virtual teams of real-life players and earn points based on their performances in actual matches. Selecting a team that maximizes points is critical for success. However, with numerous players to choose from, analyzing past performances, predicting future outcomes, and optimizing the team within the constraints of the fantasy platform is a complex and time-consuming task. Fantasy cricket enthusiasts often lack the tools to make data-driven decisions, leading to suboptimal team selections and missed opportunities to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem**\n",
    "Participants face the challenge of selecting the best possible team within a limited budget and set constraints such as the maximum number of players from a particular team or country. The lack of predictive insights into player performance in upcoming matches makes it difficult to make informed decisions, ultimately affecting their ranking and success in fantasy leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Customer**\n",
    "The primary customers are **fantasy cricket enthusiasts** who actively participate in platforms like Dream11, MPL, and My11Circle. Secondary customers include **platform developers** seeking to enhance user experience and engagement through personalized recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Product**\n",
    "The solution offers a seamless experience where users input a list of 22 potential players. The application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predicts the fantasy points each player is likely to score in the upcoming match using an LSTM-based model trained on historical performance data.\n",
    "2. Optimizes the selection of 11 players using linear programming, considering constraints like budget, team composition, and player availability.\n",
    "3. Provides a detailed breakdown of predicted points, team balance, and justification for each selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can interact with a web-based interface or mobile app that allows them to input player lists, review predictions, and finalize their team with a single click.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "1. **Develop and deploy the fantasy points prediction model**:  \n",

    "   Implement linear programming to select the best 11 players, ensuring it adheres to platform constraints within **4 months**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhance user engagement and retention**:  \n",
    "   Increase user session length by **30%** and retention rate by **20%** within **3 months** post-launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide real-time recommendations and updates**:  \n",
    "   Enable real-time updates and team suggestions based on the latest player data within **6 months** of deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Risks & Challenges**\n",
    "- **Data Quality & Availability**:  \n",
    "  Limited or inconsistent historical performance data can affect prediction accuracy.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Model Generalization**:  \n",
    "  The model may struggle to generalize predictions for new or less-experienced players.  \n",
    "  *Mitigation*: Incorporate player similarity metrics and contextual features like pitch conditions and opposition strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform Constraints**:  \n",
    "  Different fantasy platforms have varying rules, which may complicate optimization.  \n",
    "  *Mitigation*: Design a flexible optimization module that can be customized for different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Trust & Adoption**:  \n",
    "  Users may hesitate to trust automated team selection.  \n",
    "  *Mitigation*: Provide detailed explanations for each recommendation and allow users to customize selections.\n",
